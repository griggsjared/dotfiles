# AGENT Guidelines

1. **Reference surrounding code** - Always examine and match patterns, style, and conventions from similar or nearby code when making edits.

2. **Minimal comments** - Refrain from adding superfluous comments. Only add comments when necessary to explain complicated or complex logic.

3. **Update tests** - Always check for corresponding tests when editing code. Update tests to maintain appropriate coverage and follow existing test patterns and conventions.

4. **Follow project conventions** - Check for linters, formatters, and configuration files (eslint, prettier, etc.). Follow the project's established conventions and formatting rules.
